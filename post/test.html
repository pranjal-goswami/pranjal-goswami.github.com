    <p>
    In august last year Twitter launched twitter bootstrap which is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It brings a plethora of opportunities to do awesome stuff on the web without focusing on the design. Bootstrap is a boon for developers who lack a knack in visual design. It makes the pages look sleek and decent enough giving you more time to work on the application. Also the frontend development using bootstrap is fast and easy.

    <strong>#1: Ready to use components</strong>
    <p><br />
    	Twitter Bootstrap gives you a lot of ready to use components like the Navigation, Dropdown Menus, BreadCrumbs, Pagination and many more.

     <br />
    <strong>#2: Prebuilt Grid</strong>
    <p><br />
    	Bootstrap lets you make a fluid page layout using prebuilt grid within minutes. The most important job of a web designer of making the page layout which also is fluid and is all good for any device width is done with the least effort.

     <br />
    <strong>#3: Buttons, Progress Bars and Alerts</strong>
    <p><br />
    	Using the Bootstrap framework you can make stylized command buttons on the go. Bootstrap offers a set of pre-styles command buttons that are more than enough for general use. A form button or even a link looks great when rendered with bootstrap css. <br />
        Let alone the buttons, the progress bars and alerts are also an awesome feature. You need not write any extra css for making alerts and animated progress bars.

    <br />
    <strong>#4: LESS</strong>
    <p><br />
    LESS, the increasingly famous CSS preprocessor, gets a big endorsement here from Twitter with a ton of built in support. They've really gone all out and created a lot of LESS mixins and variables for you to work with right out of the box. You can customize the grid or the entire css without any hassle.

    <strong>#5: Gallery</strong>
    <p><br />
    The Galleries in Bootstrap are fairly automated. You need not trouble yourself with adjusting the elements and the css to give it a perfect look. Here, just add in some classes to an unordered list and bootstrap takes care of all your troubles of making a image gallery
    </p>
    
    <br />
    <strong>#6: Javascript Plugins</strong>
    <p><br />
